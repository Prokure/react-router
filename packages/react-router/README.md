# react-horizotnal-router

Declarative _horizotnal routing_ for [React](https://facebook.github.io/react).

## Installation

Using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

    $ npm install --save react--horizontal-router

**Note:** This repository is a fork of `react-router`. It includes HorizontalSwitch which enables Microsort Azure dashboard sort of Horizontal Routing feature where you can open multiple components on the same screen
horizontally whenever you click on a new link.

**I need to added the working example for this.**

```js
// using ES6 modules
import { Router, Route, HorizontalSwitch } from "react-horizontal-router";

// using CommonJS modules
var Router = require("react-horizontal-router").Router;
var Route = require("react-horizontal-router").Route;
var HorizontalSwitch = require("react-horizontal-router").HorizontalSwitch;
```
